# Changelog

All notable changes to Open CoDesign are documented here. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Top-bar usage badge** — the desktop app now shows per-run context-window usage, token totals, and provider cost in USD next to the model picker, with a hover panel for the full breakdown.
- **Automatic checklist continuation** — if an agent run ends with unchecked `set_todos` items, Open CoDesign can now send one silent follow-up to finish the remaining work. This is enabled by default and can be turned off in Settings → Advanced.
- **Visual self-review pass** — the desktop app can now render the current preview off-screen, capture it as an image, and feed that screenshot back into the same agent for one extra refinement pass.
- **Toggleable taste controls** — Settings → Advanced now includes switches for visual self-review, the built-in anti-slop design skill, and an optional Uncodixfy-inspired cleanup skill.

### Changed

- **Preview fallback behavior** — malformed JSX/HTML artifacts no longer replace the last good preview during live updates or final snapshot writes. The canvas keeps the last valid render when possible and shows a clearer invalid-artifact state when there is no good fallback.
- **Usage persistence** — the latest usage snapshot is now stored per design, so renderer reloads and preview crashes no longer wipe the visible usage badge.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-21

Post-v0.1.0 maintenance release. No breaking changes. Focused on runtime correctness, release-pipeline polish, and prompt quality.

### Highlights

- **JSX previews unblocked** — replaced the broken React UMD vendor bundle so React/JSX artifacts render reliably.
- **Context pruning** — size-based prune of tool-call input and tool-result payloads during orchestration, with an artifact-wrapper override, so long agent sessions no longer balloon the prompt.
- **Interactive depth mandate** — prompts now require a craft-surplus minimum across every artifact type (real interactions, real states, not a wireframe).
- **Keyless providers in Codex import** — the Claude Code / Codex import flow now correctly pulls in IP-allowlisted proxies that have no API key.
- **Release pipeline** — workspace build + bundler smoke test added to CI; electron-builder auto-update metadata disabled until signing ships; all i18n menu keys supplied.
- **Packaging manifests** scaffolded for Homebrew Cask, winget, and Scoop.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-18

First public release. Electron desktop app, GitHub releases for macOS (DMG), Windows (EXE), and Linux (AppImage). Installers are unsigned in v0.1 — code-signing + opt-in auto-update land in v0.5.

### Added

- **Unified provider model** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, SiliconFlow, local Ollama, and any OpenAI-compatible relay. Switch in Settings with no hardcoded shortlists.
- **Dynamic model picker** — every provider exposes its real model catalogue fetched at connect time.
- **Keyless providers** — IP-allowlisted proxies (enterprise gateways, local Ollama) supported with empty API key.
- **Claude Code + Codex config import** — one-click import reads `~/.codex/config.toml` and `~/.claude/settings.json` and pulls in every provider, model, and key.
- **Prompt → HTML or JSX/React component** — rendered in a sandboxed iframe with vendored React 18 + Babel, fully on-device.
- **Twelve built-in design skill modules** — slide decks, dashboards, landing pages, SVG charts, glassmorphism, editorial typography, heroes, pricing, footers, chat UIs, data tables, calendars. The agent picks the skill that matches the brief.
- **Fifteen ready-to-edit demo prompts** — cosmic animation, organic loaders, landing page, case study, dashboard, pitch slide, email, mobile app, pricing page, blog article, event calendar, chat interface, portfolio gallery, receipt/invoice, settings panel. All localized EN + 简体中文.
- **Anti-AI-slop design Skill** injected into every generation.
- **Inline comment → AI patch loop** — click any element in the preview, leave a note, the model rewrites only that region (str_replace against stable `data-codesign-id`).
- **AI-generated tunable sliders** — the model emits the parameters worth tweaking (color, spacing, font); drag to refine without re-prompting.
- **Live agent panel** — streaming tool calls rendered in real time while the model edits files.
- **Instant design switching** — preview-iframe pool keeps the last five designs hot in memory, Hub ↔ Workspace switching is zero-delay.
- **Phone / tablet / desktop preview frames** — true responsive canvas switching.
- **Files panel** — inspect multi-file artifacts (HTML, CSS, JS) before export.
- **Connection diagnostic panel** — one-click test for any provider with actionable errors.
- **Light + dark themes**; **English + 简体中文 UI** with live language toggle.
- **Five export formats** — HTML (inlined CSS), PDF (via user's local Chrome through puppeteer-core), PPTX (pptxgenjs), ZIP asset bundle, Markdown. All exporters lazy-loaded.
- **Generation cancellation** — stop mid-stream without losing prior turns.
- **Four-tab Settings** — Models, Appearance, Storage, Advanced.
- **Local-first storage** — SQLite (better-sqlite3) for design history and snapshots; TOML (encrypted via Electron `safeStorage`) for config. No electron-store blob. XDG-compliant paths.
- **Zero mandatory telemetry, zero cloud account, zero API proxy.**
- **Install size ≤ 80 MB** across macOS and Windows installers (CI-enforced).
- **MIT license** with third-party NOTICE file and machine-readable `CITATION.cff`.

### Technical foundation

- pnpm workspace + Turborepo + Biome + TypeScript (`strict: true`, `verbatimModuleSyntax: true`)
- Electron + React 19 + Vite 6 + Tailwind v4
- `@mariozechner/pi-ai` as the multi-provider abstraction
- Vitest for unit tests (~700 tests across 11 packages), Playwright for E2E
- Sandboxed iframe renderer using esbuild-wasm + import maps
